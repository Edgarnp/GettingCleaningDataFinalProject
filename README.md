# Getting & Cleaning Data - Final Project
Final Project for Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course

This documents basic assumptions to leverage the run_analysis.R file in my GitHub folder to come up with two different outputs:
1. tidyData.txt - result of merging training and test datasets provided from the experiments using Samsung S2 smartphones on 30 subjects as part of a controlled experiment.
2. summary-output.txt - resulting of aggregating the previous dataset by subject (30 in total in the experiment) and type of activity (6 different ones surveyed by such smartphones.

Assumptions:
1. Data from the following link (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is manually downloaded to a location in your local / remote PC / Mac
2. You will set the "UCI HAR Dataset" subfolder created from unzipping the provided files as your working directory in R
3. You have installed "plyr" and "dplyr" packages. The function will require them.
